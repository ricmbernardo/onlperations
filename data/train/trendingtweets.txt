Who is it that overcomes the world Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
1 John 55

I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
Galatians 220 

Whatever happened last night, last week, last month, or last year is not what defines you. The love of your heavenly Father defines who you are a beloved daughter or son of God. Trust in His mercy and be transformed by His love.

WE JUST WANNA TALK

 
 
me Jon Snow must sit on The Iron Throne because hes the most thoughtful and caring person in the Seven Kingdoms
Jon doesnt pet Ghost when he gives him away
me Jon is no better than Cersei
.  Ghost the lovable Direwolf is looking for a new home. Abandoned by owner who is heading south. Would prefer a cold northern location. Very loyal, but not great with White Walkers. Ghost would be a great addition to your family  cant wait to find his forever home. 
YEA GHOST!!! Back in the GAME! Man somebody get the wolf a dead body to eat because he has earned it 10 times.    8  4
You are absolutely right bcos  karma awaits him for PM post from 23 may and inner belief of PM cannot be projected on your late father bcos bofors ghost and warren Anderson of Bhopal tragedy is crown tag of your father not Modi ji and you rightly said No Fight 
a starbucks cup had more scenes in season 8 than ghost had in season 7
Jon did Ghost dirty, and were not happy about it. 


Ive watched a lot of fd up stuff on Game Of Thrones, but dipping on Ghost like that was by far the most brutal.
happy international with roots above and branches below day be blessed and know a ghost
Wow!  7 years since Overjoyed and the song Im never allowed to add to the setlist anymore and since phone cameras were apparently filtered through an actual ghost 
Ghost gotta join the actors guild or something this is unacceptable
They did Ghost so dirty smh Why even have him survive if this was the end Game 
Well, I think my girl Dany just reached her breaking point. 
1. Finds out the second love of her life is her nephewhas a better claim to the throne than her.
2. See Jons people rather have him as a King. 
3. Watches her 2nd dragon die.
4. Watches her BFF die.
 
Dany is the worst dragon owner of all time. ALL TIME 
Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet 
Tyrion i dont wanna hear innocent children being burnt alive

Dany next episode 
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
Lets be honest here. So much of the bad writing for the last few episodes has been in service of making Dany and everyone else weak enough for Cersei to matter again.
All I know is this BETTER be what we see. 

I need a Game 6 from Dany from here on out. 
Wow. Jorah getting laid by Dany the only way he was ever going to get laid.

To rest. 
we all just witnessed the moment when Dany becomes the Mad King
tyrion  varys but thousands of innocent children will die 

dany 
Jon speech a little too royal for Danys tastes. 
Dany to Greyworm after Cersei killed Missandei 
Cersei told Missandei to speak her last words. So Missandei looked her queen and the love of her life dead in the face, filled her lungs with air, and said Clap ALL of these nas

Recognize a G when you see one
   
Supposejust suppose, nowthat Jon and Dani BOTH died along with Cersei, of course. Supposejust supposethat a certain little man with a big heart ended up sitting on the Iron Throne
Tyrion think about your child

Cersei

How many times must Cersei show them that she DGAF before they actually believe her 
Cersei does something completely horrible

Everybody else Cersei, we know youre really not that bad. Youre not a monster.

Cersei 
Cersei, your enemies have stupidly approached within range of our giant crossbows and with one volley we can wipe all of them out, end this war, and the iron throne will be yours forever.

Cersei Behead her personal assistant.
Grey Worm loading up for Cersei 
me Jon Snow must sit on The Iron Throne because hes the most thoughtful and caring person in the Seven Kingdoms
Jon doesnt pet Ghost when he gives him away
me Jon is no better than Cersei
How Game of Thrones just set up Sansa to take out Cersei  
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
But like...what if Cersei wins and it ends with her smirking directly into the camera Would the whole internet burn down 
This season of Thrones is too slow, nothing crazy is happening

Cersei 
Cerseis enemies should have known better than to underestimate the sheer stubbornness and determination of a woman trying to grow out a bad pixie cut

missandei and grey worm should have just moved to Atlanta man 
Rest in paradise, Missandei of Naath. May you find peace on a sandy shore and may your curls forever pop.    
Missandeis story is what happens when the writers can not imagine a world where Black characters are fully developed so...not surprised
RT to pay respect. RIP Missandeis 
Missandei was supposed to move to Atlanta with Grey Worm 

She was supposed to enroll at Spelman.

She was supposed to start her natural hair YouTube channel.

She was supposed to be somebody. 

RIP to a real one!  
Missandei and Grey Worm deserved better.
 
Loyal until the end.    
My issue isnt that Missandeis death happened. I never expected her  Grey Worm to make it to that beach. My issue is that her death is the one way she said she didnt want to die. She died in chains with no way to defend herself. Lyanna slays a giant. Missandei should have too.
Dany to Greyworm after Cersei killed Missandei 
Dany did not deserve Missandei 
She deserved better 
RIP

Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you ... the Mad Queen.   
MAD QUEEN is coming
Mad Queen DANY SOON COME!!!
Good one ! It would be very unfair to make Daenerys a mad Queen. She deserves a better ending  TRUE! 
Dany doesnt belong on the throne. Jon doesnt belong on the throne. You know who does No one. And thats a fact  a possible nod to Arya. But thats the message of the show. None of them are fit. Dany is the Mad Queen. Jons the Undead King.
Is  really coming down to one mad queen vs. another, with a reasonable man waiting in the wings 
Nope, sorry, Daenerys Targaryen is NOT the Mad Queen on   
great love 2 watch evil queen vs mad queen so a humble unwilling man can take a throne lmao
Thoughts on Episode Four. I find Danys decline sad to see. Shes being stripped of everyone and everything she loves and trusts. The show is telegraphing a turn to Mad Queen Daenerys. Will she turn back Oh, and Jon Snow pulls a Ned

Jaime really the only person who can kill Cersei. Unless Arya borrows his face to do it herself. 

 
I pray at the altar of Brienne and Jaime boning forever and always.

 
Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.

Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.
Remember when Sansa was like you know, it actually was a good thing I got raped and otherwise assaulted and abused all those times, bc now I am a Strong Woman. Interesting.  
Every pundit But Sansa is just not likable enough, also her 9000 well thoughtout policy papers are not fun to read. On the other hand, Jon just has that special something, you know!!

Daenerys turns into a villain, and Varys channels his inner libertarian, asking whether the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule.    via 
This is terrible writing. This means all of Danys advisers forgot about the Iron Fleet too. Jon, Varys, Tyrion, Davos, Grey Worm and company just forgot about the baddest fleet in Westeros  
So were Tyrion  Varys just making an argument that Jon is more electable than Dany Or have I crossed the politics  GoT streams
If your spouse said Euron Greyjoy was their favorite character, youd have to immediately divorce right
I respect taking Euron Greyjoy, possibly the most unequivocally evil and terrifying book characters, and making him Cyrus from Trailer Park Boys
Theres lots of unconventional favorite GOT character choices. I could see great arguments made for Sam, Yara, Theon, hell even Ramsay or Joffrey cause theyre such insane villains. But if you like Euron Greyjoy you got major problemos my friend
Euron trying to figure out how Tyrion know Cersei pregnant ones  
Tyrion Cersei do it for your child youre expecting

Euron 
Euron Greyjoy looks like a can of Axe body spray
Its truly unfair that Euron Greyjoy gets to be a more important villain than the Night King
I hope Euron Greyjoy the character gets burned and eaten. And not by a dragon either by a legion of pissed off  fans.  might wanna think about paying my therapy bills  because I suddenly gots lots of hate in my heart for a fictional beard boy on a boat..

I doubt most people will agree with me on this, but even though I enjoyed both, I think SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse was a better comic book movie than Avengers Endgame.

For those of you who didnt think the Starbucks cup gaffe was real, I went back to watch it and

 
Uh oh.....

 
Youre telling me they had TWO YEARS to put together a decent show and they couldnt even spot the goddamn Starbucks cup in Winterfell!!  
Ok this might actually be the single saddest shot of the entire series.

JON. WHY.  
Being a Starkbucks barista is not an easy job
 
Even as someone who likes  in general, I cant help but think about how much better this show would have been if theyd had more women, poc, and woc writing and directing it. Just, every part of it would have been improved.

Who is it that overcomes the world Only the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God.
1 John 55

I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
Galatians 220 

Whatever happened last night, last week, last month, or last year is not what defines you. The love of your heavenly Father defines who you are a beloved daughter or son of God. Trust in His mercy and be transformed by His love.

Jon doesnt pet Ghost when he gives him away
me Jon is no better than Cersei
.  Ghost the lovable Direwolf is looking for a new home. Abandoned by owner who is heading south. Would prefer a cold northern location. Very loyal, but not great with White Walkers. Ghost would be a great addition to your family  cant wait to find his forever home. 
YEA GHOST!!! Back in the GAME! Man somebody get the wolf a dead body to eat because he has earned it 10 times.    8  4
You are absolutely right bcos  karma awaits him for PM post from 23 may and inner belief of PM cannot be projected on your late father bcos bofors ghost and warren Anderson of Bhopal tragedy is crown tag of your father not Modi ji and you rightly said No Fight 
a starbucks cup had more scenes in season 8 than ghost had in season 7
Jon did Ghost dirty, and were not happy about it. 


Ive watched a lot of fd up stuff on Game Of Thrones, but dipping on Ghost like that was by far the most brutal.
happy international with roots above and branches below day be blessed and know a ghost
Wow!  7 years since Overjoyed and the song Im never allowed to add to the setlist anymore and since phone cameras were apparently filtered through an actual ghost 
Ghost gotta join the actors guild or something this is unacceptable
They did Ghost so dirty smh Why even have him survive if this was the end Game 
Well, I think my girl Dany just reached her breaking point. 
1. Finds out the second love of her life is her nephewhas a better claim to the throne than her.
2. See Jons people rather have him as a King. 
3. Watches her 2nd dragon die.
4. Watches her BFF die.
 
Dany is the worst dragon owner of all time. ALL TIME 
Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet 
Tyrion i dont wanna hear innocent children being burnt alive

Dany next episode 
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
Lets be honest here. So much of the bad writing for the last few episodes has been in service of making Dany and everyone else weak enough for Cersei to matter again.
All I know is this BETTER be what we see. 

I need a Game 6 from Dany from here on out. 
Wow. Jorah getting laid by Dany the only way he was ever going to get laid.

To rest. 
we all just witnessed the moment when Dany becomes the Mad King
tyrion  varys but thousands of innocent children will die 

dany 
Jon speech a little too royal for Danys tastes.

Supposejust suppose, nowthat Jon and Dani BOTH died along with Cersei, of course. Supposejust supposethat a certain little man with a big heart ended up sitting on the Iron Throne
Tyrion think about your child

Cersei

How many times must Cersei show them that she DGAF before they actually believe her 
Cersei does something completely horrible

Everybody else Cersei, we know youre really not that bad. Youre not a monster.

Cersei 
Cersei, your enemies have stupidly approached within range of our giant crossbows and with one volley we can wipe all of them out, end this war, and the iron throne will be yours forever.

Cersei Behead her personal assistant.
Grey Worm loading up for Cersei 
me Jon Snow must sit on The Iron Throne because hes the most thoughtful and caring person in the Seven Kingdoms
Jon doesnt pet Ghost when he gives him away
me Jon is no better than Cersei
How Game of Thrones just set up Sansa to take out Cersei  
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
But like...what if Cersei wins and it ends with her smirking directly into the camera Would the whole internet burn down 
This season of Thrones is too slow, nothing crazy is happening

Cersei 
Cerseis enemies should have known better than to underestimate the sheer stubbornness and determination of a woman trying to grow out a bad pixie cut

Rest in paradise, Missandei of Naath. May you find peace on a sandy shore and may your curls forever pop.    
Missandeis story is what happens when the writers can not imagine a world where Black characters are fully developed so...not surprised
RT to pay respect. RIP Missandeis 
Missandei was supposed to move to Atlanta with Grey Worm 

She was supposed to enroll at Spelman.

She was supposed to start her natural hair YouTube channel.

She was supposed to be somebody. 

RIP to a real one!  
Missandei and Grey Worm deserved better.
 
Loyal until the end.    
My issue isnt that Missandeis death happened. I never expected her  Grey Worm to make it to that beach. My issue is that her death is the one way she said she didnt want to die. She died in chains with no way to defend herself. Lyanna slays a giant. Missandei should have too.
Dany to Greyworm after Cersei killed Missandei 
Dany did not deserve Missandei 
She deserved better

Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you ... the Mad Queen.   
MAD QUEEN is coming
Mad Queen DANY SOON COME!!!
Good one ! It would be very unfair to make Daenerys a mad Queen. She deserves a better ending  TRUE! 
Dany doesnt belong on the throne. Jon doesnt belong on the throne. You know who does No one. And thats a fact  a possible nod to Arya. But thats the message of the show. None of them are fit. Dany is the Mad Queen. Jons the Undead King.
Is  really coming down to one mad queen vs. another, with a reasonable man waiting in the wings 
Nope, sorry, Daenerys Targaryen is NOT the Mad Queen on   
great love 2 watch evil queen vs mad queen so a humble unwilling man can take a throne lmao
Thoughts on Episode Four. I find Danys decline sad to see. Shes being stripped of everyone and everything she loves and trusts. The show is telegraphing a turn to Mad Queen Daenerys. Will she turn back Oh, and Jon Snow pulls a Ned

Jaime really the only person who can kill Cersei. Unless Arya borrows his face to do it herself. 

 
I pray at the altar of Brienne and Jaime boning forever and always.

 
Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.

They lit Rhaegal up like Denzel in Training Day
People are heartbroken after those two brutal moments on  
Why is Brienne suddenly acting like shes in a romcom How does Rhaegal just get shot out of the sky Where the hell is Yara Greyjoy Why cant anyone Jon, Varys, Tyrion make up their damn mind AND WHEN DID STARBUCKS OPEN IN WINTERFELL! 
Between Ygritte, Rhaegal and Dany, it would appear that theres a shot clock for everything Jon Snow rides

Jon Swear you wont tell anybody Im the real heir to the throne.

Sansa

 

Jon I need to tell Sansa and Arya the truth 

Daenerys 
How Game of Thrones just set up Sansa to take out Cersei  
I think Im in love with Sansa cause Im in love with Sophie Turner Jonas!!!!
SANSA TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE.

YOU LOST TROOPS, A DRAGON, AND AN ADVISOR.
 can I tell you a secret, and you promise not to tell anyone
 for sure

Sansa, exactly five seconds later 
Sansa and Arya will save the seven kingdoms. 
Just want it on the record that Ive been Team Sansa since day one.
Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.
Remember when Sansa was like you know, it actually was a good thing I got raped and otherwise assaulted and abused all those times, bc now I am a Strong Woman. Interesting.  
Every pundit But Sansa is just not likable enough, also her 9000 well thoughtout policy papers are not fun to read. On the other hand, Jon just has that special something, you know!!
jon snow dont tell ANYONE

sansa i promise 

sansa 5 mins later 
If I were in charge of HBO I would greenlight a new show called Tyrion And Varys Just Talking To Each Other
Team Varys the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule. 
varys is gonna plant a few stories about daenerys likability problem in the westeros times
tyrion  varys but thousands of innocent children will die

Is it me Or is Varys the only one making sense this episode    
Varys is the Cyrus Beene of Westeros. hes looking out for the Republic at all times
You know. Varys might be the most honest person in the whole show who truly cares for the people. His allegiance never wavers.
Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, Ill use them. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie Not with any king or queen, but with the people.

First time I actually liked the guy.

Why is Brienne suddenly acting like shes in a romcom How does Rhaegal just get shot out of the sky Where the hell is Yara Greyjoy Why cant anyone Jon, Varys, Tyrion make up their damn mind AND WHEN DID STARBUCKS OPEN IN WINTERFELL! 
Daenerys turns into a villain, and Varys channels his inner libertarian, asking whether the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule.    via 
This is terrible writing. This means all of Danys advisers forgot about the Iron Fleet too. Jon, Varys, Tyrion, Davos, Grey Worm and company just forgot about the baddest fleet in Westeros  
So were Tyrion  Varys just making an argument that Jon is more electable than Dany Or have I crossed the politics  GoT streams
If your spouse said Euron Greyjoy was their favorite character, youd have to immediately divorce right
I respect taking Euron Greyjoy, possibly the most unequivocally evil and terrifying book characters, and making him Cyrus from Trailer Park Boys
Theres lots of unconventional favorite GOT character choices. I could see great arguments made for Sam, Yara, Theon, hell even Ramsay or Joffrey cause theyre such insane villains. But if you like Euron Greyjoy you got major problemos my friend
Euron trying to figure out how Tyrion know Cersei pregnant ones  
Tyrion Cersei do it for your child youre expecting

Euron 
Euron Greyjoy looks like a can of Axe body spray
Its truly unfair that Euron Greyjoy gets to be a more important villain than the Night King
I hope Euron Greyjoy the character gets burned and eaten. And not by a dragon either by a legion of pissed off  fans.  might wanna think about paying my therapy bills  because I suddenly gots lots of hate in my heart for a fictional beard boy on a boat..

How Euron pulled up on Dany Dragon 
Dany I am the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms, The Breaker of Chains. I will lead the Unsullied and the Dothraki against Kings Landing and defeat Cersei in the Red Keep.
Euron Greyjoy shows up with like ten ships
Dany 
Tormund starting to look better and better now isnt he    
Tormund and the Hound are big moods  
Tormund wouldnt have done Brienne like that. 
wow lets all pray for Tormund during this difficult time
No one

Literally no one

Tormund
 
Tormunds room  
tormund would never. he would NEVER 
I have never felt so kismet with a character on  than I have with Tormund this episode. I know that feel, buddy.  
Jaime, Tormund and Brienne are really living in their own teen romcom  lmfao
tormund antes de queer eye  tormund depois de queer eye 
Tormund to the hound 
She had a good guy in Tormund but chose to go for the yahoo boy with gold hand.

Live with your decisions.

Oh so NOW Tom is all concerned about spoilers Watch the new SpiderMan Far From Home trailer right here! 
The moral of every SpiderMan movie is that the middleaged men you worship will eventually betray you, and that is 100 correct. 
The brand new SpiderMan Far From Home trailer is here with an Endgame spoiler warning


SpiderMan Far From Home is going to be an extremely important movie for the next phase of Marvel Films.  Multiverse sets up not only Miles Morales but a way to bring in Fantastic Four, XMen and big villains.  Lets Go
  
I doubt most people will agree with me on this, but even though I enjoyed both, I think SpiderMan Into the SpiderVerse was a better comic book movie than Avengers Endgame.

Its funnier, tighter, has a better story, has more heart, and its more interesting to look at, too. 
FANS Oh my God, SpiderMan battles Mysterio, a villain known for his tricks and lies

MYSTERIO Yeah, um, hah, Im from another dimension

FANS We automatically believe this
SPOILER ALERT The new trailer for SpiderMan Far From Home is here  
Two years ago today, 301 dropped Everybody.

The album featured hit singles such as, Everybody, Black SpiderMan, and the powerful 18002738255.

Everybody debuted at 1 on the Billboard Top 200 and was also certified platinum last year.  
For months people have been concern trolling that Sony would pull Spidey from the MCU they arent and then the new Far From Home trailer is trying to set him up as the new Iron Man. 

SpiderMan and his villains will be key parts of the MCU beyond Far From Home.
SpiderMan came to play some baseball tonight 9 
The  trailer teases the existence of an MCU multiverse. Could this mean that Deadpool, the XMen, the Fantastic Four and the Miles Morales SpiderMan could be heading to the world of the Avengers

Ghost gotta join the actors guild or something this is unacceptable
They did Ghost so dirty smh Why even have him survive if this was the end Game 
Well, I think my girl Dany just reached her breaking point. 1. Finds out the second love of her life is her nephewhas a better claim to the throne than her. 2. See Jons people rather have him as a King. 3. Watches her 2nd dragon die. 4. Watches her BFF die. 
Dany is the worst dragon owner of all time. ALL TIME 
Dany kind of forgot about the Iron Fleet 
Tyrion i dont wanna hear innocent children being burnt alive Dany next episode 
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
Lets be honest here. So much of the bad writing for the last few episodes has been in service of making Dany and everyone else weak enough for Cersei to matter again.
All I know is this BETTER be what we see. I need a Game 6 from Dany from here on out. 
Wow. Jorah getting laid by Dany the only way he was ever going to get laid. To rest. 
we all just witnessed the moment when Dany becomes the Mad King
tyrion varys but thousands of innocent children will die dany 
Jon speech a little too royal for Danys tastes. 
Dany to Greyworm after Cersei killed Missandei 
Cersei told Missandei to speak her last words. So Missandei looked her queen and the love of her life dead in the face, filled her lungs with air, and said Clap ALL of these nas Recognize a G when you see one 
Supposejust suppose, nowthat Jon and Dani BOTH died along with Cersei, of course. Supposejust supposethat a certain little man with a big heart ended up sitting on the Iron Throne
Tyrion think about your child Cersei 
How many times must Cersei show them that she DGAF before they actually believe her 
Cersei does something completely horrible Everybody else Cersei, we know youre really not that bad. Youre not a monster. Cersei 
Cersei, your enemies have stupidly approached within range of our giant crossbows and with one volley we can wipe all of them out, end this war, and the iron throne will be yours forever. Cersei Behead her personal assistant.
Grey Worm loading up for Cersei 
me Jon Snow must sit on The Iron Throne because hes the most thoughtful and caring person in the Seven Kingdoms Jon doesnt pet Ghost when he gives him away me Jon is no better than Cersei
How Game of Thrones just set up Sansa to take out Cersei 
Shole did. And they wont listen to her. She tried to tell Dany her plan was stupid. Shes tried to tell all of them they keep underestimating Cersei. 
But like...what if Cersei wins and it ends with her smirking directly into the camera Would the whole internet burn down 
This season of Thrones is too slow, nothing crazy is happening Cersei 
Cerseis enemies should have known better than to underestimate the sheer stubbornness and determination of a woman trying to grow out a bad pixie cut

Cersei told Missandei to speak her last words. So Missandei looked her queen and the love of her life dead in the face, filled her lungs with air, and said Clap ALL of these nas Recognize a G when you see one 
missandei and grey worm should have just moved to Atlanta man 
Rest in paradise, Missandei of Naath. May you find peace on a sandy shore and may your curls forever pop. 
Missandeis story is what happens when the writers can not imagine a world where Black characters are fully developed so...not surprised
RT to pay respect. RIP Missandeis 
Missandei was supposed to move to Atlanta with Grey Worm She was supposed to enroll at Spelman. She was supposed to start her natural hair YouTube channel. She was supposed to be somebody. RIP to a real one! 
Missandei and Grey Worm deserved better. 
Loyal until the end. 
My issue isnt that Missandeis death happened. I never expected her Grey Worm to make it to that beach. My issue is that her death is the one way she said she didnt want to die. She died in chains with no way to defend herself. Lyanna slays a giant. Missandei should have too.
Dany to Greyworm after Cersei killed Missandei 
Dany did not deserve Missandei 
She deserved better RIP

HBO just issued a statement on the coffee cup in last nights Game of Throne The latte that appeared in the episode was a mistake. Daenerys had ordered an herbal tea.
DAENERYS IS GOING TO GO SUPER SAIYAN NEXT EPISODE 
Live look at trying to convince the realm that doesnt deserve the Iron Throne. 
Movie blunders Daenerys Starbucks cup. Because even the Mother of Dragons needs a good cup o Joe. 
Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce to you ... the Mad Queen. 
MAD QUEEN is coming
Mad Queen DANY SOON COME!!!
Good one ! It would be very unfair to make Daenerys a mad Queen. She deserves a better ending TRUE! 
Dany doesnt belong on the throne. Jon doesnt belong on the throne. You know who does No one. And thats a fact a possible nod to Arya. But thats the message of the show. None of them are fit. Dany is the Mad Queen. Jons the Undead King.
Is really coming down to one mad queen vs. another, with a reasonable man waiting in the wings 
Nope, sorry, Daenerys Targaryen is NOT the Mad Queen on 
great love 2 watch evil queen vs mad queen so a humble unwilling man can take a throne lmao
Thoughts on Episode Four. I find Danys decline sad to see. Shes being stripped of everyone and everything she loves and trusts. The show is telegraphing a turn to Mad Queen Daenerys. Will she turn back Oh, and Jon Snow pulls a Ned 
Mad Queen itching to get out. 
Spoiler alert! Mad queen is coming for yall. 
Game of Thrones Mad Queen theory how it applies to Daenerys Targaryen, explained 
Real Mad Queen hours are upon us 
 predictions Jaime is riding to Kings Landing to kill Cersei he lied to Brienne to keep her safefrom going with him. The Stark sistersVarys have a plan to take out Daenerys the twist will be that Jon was also in on it because he knows shes the Mad Queen.

Jaime... to do what youre doing now to Brienne... for Cersei... You deserve all the dragon fire. 
Jaime Lannister Energy 
Jaime really the only person who can kill Cersei. Unless Arya borrows his face to do it herself. 
I pray at the altar of Brienne and Jaime boning forever and always. 
Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.

Between Ygritte, Rhaegal and Dany, it would appear that theres a shot clock for everything Jon Snow rides
Dragons might be the deadliest weapon the world has ever seen, but even they have their limits. Beware Game of Thrones spoilers lie within. 
I keep telling my dogs tonight that I would never do them dirty the way ones just did to Ghost and Rhaegal.

Jon Swear you wont tell anybody Im the real heir to the throne. Sansa 
 Jon I need to tell Sansa and Arya the truth Daenerys 
How Game of Thrones just set up Sansa to take out Cersei 
I think Im in love with Sansa cause Im in love with Sophie Turner Jonas!!!!
SANSA TOLD YOU NOT TO GO DOWN THERE. YOU LOST TROOPS, A DRAGON, AND AN ADVISOR.
 can I tell you a secret, and you promise not to tell anyone for sure Sansa, exactly five seconds later 
Sansa and Arya will save the seven kingdoms. 
Just want it on the record that Ive been Team Sansa since day one.
Sansa saying shes only the badass she is because of the trauma inflicted on her by men is so awful and untrue, and Brienne bawling over Jaime is not the Brienne we have come to know and love. And Missandei deserved better.
Remember when Sansa was like you know, it actually was a good thing I got raped and otherwise assaulted and abused all those times, bc now I am a Strong Woman. Interesting. 
Every pundit But Sansa is just not likable enough, also her 9000 well thoughtout policy papers are not fun to read. On the other hand, Jon just has that special something, you know!!
jon snow dont tell ANYONE sansa i promise sansa 5 mins later 
If your spouse said Euron Greyjoy was their favorite character, youd have to immediately divorce right
I respect taking Euron Greyjoy, possibly the most unequivocally evil and terrifying book characters, and making him Cyrus from Trailer Park Boys
Theres lots of unconventional favorite GOT character choices. I could see great arguments made for Sam, Yara, Theon, hell even Ramsay or Joffrey cause theyre such insane villains. But if you like Euron Greyjoy you got major problemos my friend
Euron trying to figure out how Tyrion know Cersei pregnant ones 
Tyrion Cersei do it for your child youre expecting Euron 
Euron Greyjoy looks like a can of Axe body spray
Its truly unfair that Euron Greyjoy gets to be a more important villain than the Night King
I hope Euron Greyjoy the character gets burned and eaten. And not by a dragon either by a legion of pissed off fans. might wanna think about paying my therapy bills because I suddenly gots lots of hate in my heart for a fictional beard boy on a boat..

Dany I am the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms, The Breaker of Chains. I will lead the Unsullied and the Dothraki against Kings Landing and defeat Cersei in the Red Keep. Euron Greyjoy shows up with like ten ships Dany 
If I were in charge of HBO I would greenlight a new show called Tyrion And Varys Just Talking To Each Other
Team Varys the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule. 
varys is gonna plant a few stories about daenerys likability problem in the westeros times

Is it me Or is Varys the only one making sense this episode 
Varys is the Cyrus Beene of Westeros. hes looking out for the Republic at all times
You know. Varys might be the most honest person in the whole show who truly cares for the people. His allegiance never wavers.
Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty. As long as I have my eyes, Ill use them. You wish to know where my true loyalties lie Not with any king or queen, but with the people. First time I actually liked the guy. 
Why is Brienne suddenly acting like shes in a romcom How does Rhaegal just get shot out of the sky Where the hell is Yara Greyjoy Why cant anyone Jon, Varys, Tyrion make up their damn mind AND WHEN DID STARBUCKS OPEN IN WINTERFELL! 
Daenerys turns into a villain, and Varys channels his inner libertarian, asking whether the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule. via 
This is terrible writing. This means all of Danys advisers forgot about the Iron Fleet too. Jon, Varys, Tyrion, Davos, Grey Worm and company just forgot about the baddest fleet in Westeros 
So were Tyrion Varys just making an argument that Jon is more electable than Dany Or have I crossed the politics GoT streams
Tormund starting to look better and better now isnt he 
Tormund and the Hound are big moods 
Tormund wouldnt have done Brienne like that. 
wow lets all pray for Tormund during this difficult time
No one Literally no one Tormund 
Tormunds room 
tormund would never. he would NEVER 
I have never felt so kismet with a character on than I have with Tormund this episode. I know that feel, buddy. 
Jaime, Tormund and Brienne are really living in their own teen romcom lmfao
tormund antes de queer eye tormund depois de queer eye 
Tormund to the hound 
She had a good guy in Tormund but chose to go for the yahoo boy with gold hand. Live with your decisions.

Euron trying to figure out how Tyrion know Cersei pregnant ones 
Tyrion Cersei do it for your child youre expecting Euron 
If I were in charge of HBO I would greenlight a new show called Tyrion And Varys Just Talking To Each Other
Team Varys the best ruler might be someone who doesnt want to rule. 
varys is gonna plant a few stories about daenerys likability problem in the westeros times
tyrion varys but thousands of innocent children will die dany 
Updated odds to rule Westeros Jon Snow Aegon +165 Sansa +375 Daenerys +550 Gendry +550 Bran +800 Tyrion +850 Arya +1400 Jon Daenerys baby +1400 Cersei +2000 Littlefinger +2000 Samwell +2500 Bronn +5000 Jaime +5000 Varys +6600 Davos +10000 Euron +10000
Tormund starting to look better and better now isnt he

Beto ORourke on Trump Yes, there has to be consequences. Yes, there has to be accountability. Yes, I think theres enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with impeachment. 
The Palestinians want to be free of the existence of Israel. Their charter calls for the destruction of Israel. They are a terror state and must be treated as such. You are a complete disgrace to the House of Representatives. 
 Action Today we are calling the House of Representatives at 2022243121 asking our Rep to Vote YES on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Barr in for failing to provide the complete Mueller Report to Congress.
This week the House of Representatives took a critical and historic step to pass the EQUALITY Act, and ban discrimination against LGBTQ Americans in every state. 
Steve Mnuchin shouldnt be allowed to shield Trumps tax returns from the House of Representatives. But this fight between the Executive and Legislative branches naturally falls upon the Supreme Court to decide, which is unfortunately majority Republican.

Its why I have no regrets over resigning from Cabinet government over the issue of The writing was on the wall in 2014 No commitment to end occupation or rebuild Gaza No attempt to stop settlement building No challenge to HR abuse No peace process No honest brokers 
As usual, BJP sabotaged from within. If Modi cant clean the party of saboteurs, hell find himself out of office sooner than he thinks. Poor selection of union cabinet ministers has been one of this govts biggest failures 
Seems about right for this administration, with its record of cabinet secretaries encountering troubling ethics issues. Under 3 months for an Attorney General to be charged with contempt by Congress. 
The worlds most decorated football club has added another trophy to the cabinet. Rangers win the 201819 Reserves League, beating Falkirk 31 and pipping Hibernian and Celtic on the final day.

Beto ORourke on Trump Yes, there has to be consequences. Yes, there has to be accountability. Yes, I think theres enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with impeachment. 
The Palestinians want to be free of the existence of Israel. Their charter calls for the destruction of Israel. They are a terror state and must be treated as such. You are a complete disgrace to the House of Representatives. 
 Action Today we are calling the House of Representatives at 2022243121 asking our Rep to Vote YES on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Barr in for failing to provide the complete Mueller Report to Congress.
This week the House of Representatives took a critical and historic step to pass the EQUALITY Act, and ban discrimination against LGBTQ Americans in every state. 
Steve Mnuchin shouldnt be allowed to shield Trumps tax returns from the House of Representatives. But this fight between the Executive and Legislative branches naturally falls upon the Supreme Court to decide, which is unfortunately majority Republican.

Buckingham Palace have released a statement confirming the birth of a son to the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. The notice has been presented at the palace gates stating the Duchess gave birth at 5.26am on the 6th May 2019. Both Meghan and the are doing well. . 
The name of the baby boy will be announced in due course, the palace said. 
BREAKING Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to a boy. The baby weighs 7 lbs, 3 oz and both Meghan and the child are doing well, the palace says. 
 The Duchess of Sussex has given birth to a baby son weighing 7lbs 3oz and mother and child are doing well, the palace has announced 
Not that it will matter to most people but for journalists, the palaces handling of that announcement was an absolute shambles. It would help if the press office spent more time worrying about keeping journalists informed and less time on Instagram and overseas organisations.

Paul Pierce was right about it being over after Game 1

BREAKING Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, has given birth to a boy. The baby weighs 7 lbs, 3 oz and both Meghan and the child are doing well, the palace says. 
 The Duchess of Sussex has given birth to a baby son weighing 7lbs 3oz and mother and child are doing well, the palace has announced 
Not that it will matter to most people but for journalists, the palaces handling of that announcement was an absolute shambles. It would help if the press office spent more time worrying about keeping journalists informed and less time on Instagram and overseas organisations.
BILLY PORTER HAS ARRIVED!!!!!!!!! 
Billy Porter is making his Pink Carpet entrance 
Summer inspiration. Thank you, Billy Porter 
We asked Billy Porter to describe his look in 3 words. His response Diana Ross, Mahogany. 
Hold on. Billy Porter just ended it all. Everyone else go home. Immediately.

Lily Collins does Priscilla Presley. Works for me. 
I LOVE Lily Collins!!! She is never afraid to really go for it. 
Lily Collins makeup artist Fiona Stiles weighs in on camp Isnt that the hardest part defining camp I grew up loving terrible, schlocky horror films, I love John Waters movies, I love punk rock and glam rock 
Its why I have no regrets over resigning from Cabinet government over the issue of The writing was on the wall in 2014 No commitment to end occupation or rebuild Gaza No attempt to stop settlement building No challenge to HR abuse No peace process No honest brokers 
As usual, BJP sabotaged from within. If Modi cant clean the party of saboteurs, hell find himself out of office sooner than he thinks. Poor selection of union cabinet ministers has been one of this govts biggest failures 
Seems about right for this administration, with its record of cabinet secretaries encountering troubling ethics issues. Under 3 months for an Attorney General to be charged with contempt by Congress. 
The worlds most decorated football club has added another trophy to the cabinet. Rangers win the 201819 Reserves League, beating Falkirk 31 and pipping Hibernian and Celtic on the final day. 
Mr. , You pat your own back for others achievements but will you also take the responsibility for your cabinet min incapabilities. Hundreds of students in Karnataka may not be able to take up NEET because of delay in the train services. 12
Beto ORourke on Trump Yes, there has to be consequences. Yes, there has to be accountability. Yes, I think theres enough evidence now for the House of Representatives to move forward with impeachment. 
The Palestinians want to be free of the existence of Israel. Their charter calls for the destruction of Israel. They are a terror state and must be treated as such. You are a complete disgrace to the House of Representatives. 
 Action Today we are calling the House of Representatives at 2022243121 asking our Rep to Vote YES on Wednesday to hold Attorney General Barr in for failing to provide the complete Mueller Report to Congress.
Steve Mnuchin shouldnt be allowed to shield Trumps tax returns from the House of Representatives. But this fight between the Executive and Legislative branches naturally falls upon the Supreme Court to decide, which is unfortunately majority Republican.
This week the House of Representatives took a critical and historic step to pass the EQUALITY Act, and ban discrimination against LGBTQ Americans in every state. 
Alvin Kamara lined up in the slot on 18.9 of his receiving snaps last season the fourthmost. He racked up 645 yards after the catch overall last season. 
 Ligue 1 Team of the Week dominate this XI with players 3 Boubacar Kamara Anthony Briancon Erik Pieters 28 20 Kalifa Coulibaly 
Theres a smooth calmness that Eden Hazard plays with, even under pressure he doesnt change, his on field movement is similar Alvin Kamara which is pretty cool 
James Charles is here, sisters! 
I wanna go to the MET Gala. James Charles is there so Im assuming theres a Groupon.
James Charles is here, sisters! 
Tonight, the series finale of will make you feel some kind of way. Im excited. Youre excited. Maybe nervous. Probably terrified. So grab a friend or stranger and join our for the 2.5 hour long on !
If you watched from the beginning, go watch the first time Alec and Magnus had a drink and their last scene together. 
I think its rude that no one will help Lilith murder her son. She promised its for a good cause and Im beginning to think this Jonathon guy isnt as nice as he pretends to be. 
If you stab a demon just keep hacking away until youre sure its dead. I was taught that at my 8th birthday. Those were weird times. 
If it werent for me, youd still be eating dead flies is a great pick up line. Try it but dont.
